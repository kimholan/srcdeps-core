A core library for building dependencies from their sources during the build.
At this point `srcdeps-core` library is used only in link:https://github.com/srcdeps/srcdeps-maven[Srcdeps Maven].
However, `srcdeps-core` has an ambition to be generic enough so that a support for other Java build tools such as
Gradle or sbt can be added. Contributions are welcome!
